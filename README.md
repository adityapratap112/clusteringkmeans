📊 Advanced Clustering Techniques: K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means & Feature Engineering
🚀 Project Overview
This project explores unsupervised learning techniques with K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering, combined with Box-Cox transformation and feature engineering for enhanced performance.

🔥 Key Features & Methods Used:

✔ K-Means Clustering: Efficient segmentation using Euclidean distances

✔ Fuzzy C-Means (FCM): Allows soft clustering where points belong to multiple clusters

✔ Box-Cox Transformation: Stabilizes variance and ensures a normal distribution

✔ Feature Engineering: Enhancing cluster quality through meaningful transformations

✔ 3D Data Visualization: Visualizing high-dimensional data in a more interpretable format


📌 Graph Availability Notice
Many plots were generated using PyCharm Notebook & 3D Matplotlib, which prevents some visualizations from being saved properly.

✅ Upcoming Update: All key graphs will be uploaded separately as images soon! Stay tuned! 🚀
